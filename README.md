# EDA-with-Titanic-Data
Exploratory Data Analysis
The goal was to explore the Titanic dataset using statistics and graphs.

I calculated summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.  
Plotted histograms and boxplots to check data distribution and outliers.  
Created a correlation heatmap and pairplot to find relationships between features.  

Found that females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.  
Fare had many outliers and was right-skewed.  
SibSp and Parch showed a small positive correlation.  
Fare is positively correlated with survival.

Tools used: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.  
Files: Titanic_Cleaned.csv and titanic_eda.ipynb
